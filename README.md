The Pick & Guess game involves two players: Player 1 selects a secret 3-digit number using KEY0–KEY2 (for ones, tens, and hundreds digits respectively), with the values cycling from 0 to 9. Each digit is shown in real time on the HEX0–HEX2 7-segment displays. Once the number is set, Player 1 confirms it by pressing KEY3. The display then resets to 000, and Player 2 starts guessing the number using the same input method. After each guess (confirmed with KEY3), the system compares the digits: correct digits remain visible on the display, while incorrect ones briefly show a dash (–) before resetting to 0. Player 2 has 5 attempts to guess all three digits correctly. If successful, a win message is displayed; otherwise, a loss message is followed by the correct number. Pressing KEY3 after the game ends restarts the game.
